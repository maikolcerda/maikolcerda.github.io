The main result is the innovation diffuses faster, users pay lower prices and the platform earns higher profits when it faces a two-sided market. The platform wants to obtain a relevant number of adopters to earn profits from advertisers. Numerical solutions establish that the diffusion process is S-shaped when the utility of advertisers grows faster than the users'. Lastly, the model is tested fitting Facebook's historical data. The model closely replicates the evolution of active users and the profits Facebook has earned due to advertising.","tags":[],"title":"1.- The evolution of platform use and platform revenue: The case of Facebook.","type":"project"},{"authors":["Maikol Cerda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575323724,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575323724,"objectID":"e82ef5520e2ac26a24ed7e848760dc32","permalink":"https://maikolcerda.github.io/project/2.-mk_frictions/","publishdate":"2019-12-02T22:55:24+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/2.-mk_frictions/","section":"project","summary":"This article develops a dynamic model of duopolistic price competition to assess the impact of network externalities and switching costs on prices and entry. Results suggest that firms with higher market shares set higher prices when market frictions are relevant: the large firm exploits the locked-in phenomenon. Market frictions also make the entry and growth of small firms harder: their expected demand and value function are lower even when they set competitive prices. The latter effects are stronger when the market matures. Lastly, the model is tested fitting prices in the Chilean mobile phone market before and after the implementation of the MNP and the elimination of the tariff differentiation between on-net and off-net calls.","tags":[],"title":"2.

Much of the existing literature implies that, under increasing polarization, stronger parties can be an impediment to legislative performance and responsible policymaking (for a review, see Binder 2015). Contrary to these prevailing accounts, we hypothesize and demonstrate that weaker political parties as indicated by the rise of safe seats in the U.S. Congress instead contribute to its inability to enact programmatic policy and provide national public goods. In particular, we theorize that the decrease in electoral competitiveness between parties across House districts (as a result of path-dependent geographic development or other processes, Rodden 2019) leads to the greater misalignment of median voter preferences between individual districts, parties, and the country as a whole, which both weakens parties and inhibits their legislative capacity. To test our account, we first provide the most comprehensive evidence on the share of safe seats in U.S. House districts and its increase over time by using a number of alternative competitiveness measures over the last century. According to our descriptive analysis of the CLEA and other datasets supported by the expanded Cook Partisan Voting Index, we find that that electoral competitiveness has been, with a few fluctuations, almost steadily decreasing since the end of the 19th century. Then, we rely on the available ANES (1948-2016) and CCES (2006-2018) data to show that the rising share of safe seats is associated with the greater misalignment of the median district preferences, the median party preferences, and the median national voter preferences across time. In turn, we also show that the increase of safe seats is associated with less ability to enact programmatic policy and provide national public goods as indicated by the less frequent passage of landmark legislation in Congress after WWII (Mayhew 2005) or lower rates of delivery by the majority party on their policy agenda (Congressional Majority Party Agendas, Curry and Lee 2020). Finally, we complement our macro account with a more detailed case-study of the politics of natural disaster response, which is characterized by both clear indicators of responsible policymaking and substantial district-level variation. As previously demonstrated by Healy and Malhotra (2009), the proportion of federal government spending allocated to disaster preparedness as opposed to disaster relief within a district is indicative of the efficiency of government spending on public goods. In line with our argument, we demonstrate that more competitive districts provide a significantly greater share of total spending toward disaster preparedness. This relationship further holds even after accounting for the incidence of natural disasters, partisanship, overall spending, and other major confounding variables. In the end, we discuss the implications of our findings and complementary explanations including polarization and divided government.","tags":[],"title":"4.

A long line of literature explores how political institutions influence economic outcomes and the distribution of resources. In a recent paper, Acemoglu et al. (JPE 2019) seek to demonstrate that democracy causes growth. However, the literature suffers from two drawbacks.  First, it is often difficult to manage endogeneity problems given obvious two-way influence between politics and the economy.  Second, most studies do not disaggregate democracy in ways that generate testable propositions about causal mechanisms. Our project seeks to advance this important but flawed literature by reconceptualizing both independent and dependent variables. We deploy a combination of data bases to specify and measure independent variables. In addition to Varieties of Democracy (VDem), we use a novel data base that disaggregates elements of democratic institutions with which to track the effects of politics on the economy. This allows us to disentangle the impact of institutions on economic growth and inequality.  Instead of using an aggregate political index, we test the effects of the number of parties, party strength, and other features of democratic systems that are associated with the capacity to compete over, and implement, programmatic policies rather than supply clientelist benefits to discrete groups. To deal with omitted variable bias, we deploy a difference-in-difference specification with time and country fixed effects and an extended set of covariates. With respect to the dependent variable, we use the methodology proposed by Jones and Klenow (2016) to study the impact of political institutions relations on welfare.  Their macroeconomic-founded framework allows us to estimate a welfare measure beyond GDP that can be compared across time and place.  This allows us to deal with endogeneity concerns by accounting for life expectancy, the value of leisure, and the inequality of resources, which are all factors that affect political institutions.  We show that in countries with better political institutions people enjoy higher levels welfare.  Our preliminary results suggest strong effects of electoral competition between disciplined political parties on total factor productivity (TFP). ","tags":[],"title":"5.
